# Microfrontend Project

This project contains a server application and three client microfrontend applications: `home`, `login`, and `user`. All applications can be run simultaneously using `concurrently`.

## Running the Project

### Steps to run:

1. **Install dependencies for all applications:**

   Run the following command to install dependencies for the server and client applications:

   npm install


2.Start the server and client applications concurrently:

Use the following script to start the server application and all client applications at the same time:

npm run dev

This will start the server and client applications (on ports 3000, 3001, and 3002, respectively).
